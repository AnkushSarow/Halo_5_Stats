# Halo_5_Stats
# The Halo 5 Stats app is an Android application that allows users to lookup the stats of any valid Xbox Live gamertag. 
# Currently, there are two main tabs - The arena tab for arena based stats and the warzone tab for warzone based stats. 
# The next planned feature will be a third tab - Matches - that allows users to view stats about the last 5 matches played.
