# Halo_5_Stats
 The Halo 5 Stats app is an Android application that allows users to lookup the stats of any valid Xbox Live gamertag. 
 
# Purpose 
The purpose of this app was to combine two things - Passion for my favorite video game (Halo) and my first attempt at mobile development. This project was done over winter break. Things I have learned via this experience - 
interacting with APIs, understand asyncronous tasks, Android development, user-interace design + XML.

More relevant weapon data - Top 5 most used 

Commendation information

Restructuring of classes/implmenting a proper design pattern now that I have more knowledge regarding this
